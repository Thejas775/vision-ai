Audio Interaction ðŸ”Š : The project utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to enable audio interaction with the system.

Firebase Integration: Firebase services are employed for tasks such as storing captured images, generating download URLs, and analyzing user feedback through Firebase analytics.

Llava Model ðŸ“ˆ: The project leverages the power of the Llava model for processing images and providing relevant information.

Real-time Image Capture ðŸ“·: Vision-AI captures real-time images using the Raspberry Pi camera module.<br>

How It Works<br>

<ol>
  <li>Audio Input: Users can interact with the system using voice commands such as "Hey Vision" or "Hello Vision."</li>

<li>Image Capture: Upon receiving the command, the system captures a real-time image using the Raspberry Pi camera.</li>

<li>Prompt Recording: The user is prompted to provide additional information or ask questions related to the captured image.</li>

<li>Firebase Integration: The captured image is uploaded to Firebase storage, and a download URL is generated.</li>

<li>Llava Model Processing ðŸ“ˆ: The Llava model is invoked with the image URL and user prompt to gather relevant information.</li>

<li>Text-to-Speech Output: The output from the Llava model is converted to speech using text-to-speech technology for user feedback.</li>

<li>User Feedback and Analytics: User satisfaction and interaction data are collected through feedback forums and Firebase analytics.</li>
